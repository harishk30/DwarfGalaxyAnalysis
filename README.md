# xSAGA Dwarf Analysis

Study of dwarf satellite galaxies in xSAGA data. Analyzing how environmental factors of hosts affect formation of satellite galaxies in paired and isolated Milky Way analogs. 

Analysis done with Jupyter notebooks is stored in the experiments folder (this constitutes the bulk of the work done in this paper). The methods and code used in these experiments have been cleaned up and stored in classes, which provides an easy-to-use framework for future analysis.
